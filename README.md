        12. Cryptography
        13. ARP(address resolution protocol) poisoing
        14.snoofing
        15.Hashing()tool- meta sploit)
        16.Back door
        17.Ethical hacking - gaining authorized data with their written permission
        18. web site vs web page vs web server vs web application

        21. 3 types of hackers - white hat, grey hat, black hat
        22. WHITE HAT HACKERS - architecture(blueprint of the complete application web) will be be completely known by the hackers
        23. BLACK HAT HACKERS - they are just hackers, not have complete knowledge about architecture
        24. GREY HAT HACKERS - they are so dangerous.....mrng they r professional hackers...but not in the  night....like arambam arya.\
        best movie for hacking is MR.ROBOT
        25.SCRIPT KIDDES - just net pathu...hack panna learn pannikaruthu
        26.hacktivism-society kaga hack pandrandhu(wikilekis)
        27. wat is CIA - Confidendiality,integrity(originality),availability
        28.AUTHENTICATION- verfies someones identity
        29.AUTHORIZATION- accessing permission
        29. to verify someoine authentication: something u know (password) eg: wat is fav colour, something u(have) touch physically eg: aadhaar,phone finger print, something u r (eg: biometric)
        30.UAC-user access control
        31.ssl implements integrity
        32.encrption - connversion of simple text to cyfer text(humans cannot understand)
        33. AVAILABILITY-mainatins the availabilty of web servers...
        34. breach - the loss of control 35.EVENT-any observable occurence in a network or system. NIST SP 800-61 
        36.EXPLOIT - A particular attack. it is named this way because these attacks exploit system vulnerabilities 
        37.INCIDENT - Which affect CIA is known as incident 
        38.Intrusion- security event or combination of events
        39.THREAD-likelihood athikama irutha risk 
        40.TOE- Target of evaluation(need the difference ipv 4 and 6)
